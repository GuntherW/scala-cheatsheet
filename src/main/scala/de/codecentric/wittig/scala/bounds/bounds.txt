Upper Bounds:
An upper type bound T <: A declares that type variable T refers to a subtype of type A.

Lower Bounds:
While upper type bounds limit a type to a subtype of another type,
lower type bounds declare a type to be a supertype of another type.
The term T >: A expresses that the type parameter T or the abstract type T refer to a supertype of type A.
